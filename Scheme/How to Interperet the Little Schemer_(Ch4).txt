***Chapter 4: Number Games 8/1/2019***
In scheme all numbers are atoms.
use (atom? n) to test if a type of number is an atom.

e.g. -3 is a number but in scheme it is not considered.
e.g 3.14619 is a number but in scheme it is not considered.

Only whole numbers are considered. Or more specifically non-negative integers.

e.g.
(define sub1
  (lambda (n)
    (- n 1)))

> (sub1 0)
> -1

-1 is not considered as we only consider non-negative numbers.
